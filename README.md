# Guidetree

Heroku deployable Rails application that allows you to create custom skilltrees. Skilltrees can be used to help guide learning, goal setting, or map hierarchical relationships. Each objective (or node in the tree) can be assigned traits that help describe what could be gained by completing each objective.
